An Aspiration Prayer of Advice for Jamyang Chogdrub I pay homage to the exalted noble one, Avalokiteśvara, treasure of compassion! To spur the mind with intense renunciation of cyclic existence, Making fruitful these freedoms and advantages, which are so difficult to acquire and so easily destroyed, With wholehearted exertion in adopting and abandoning according to karmic causality- Please grant your blessings that I may plant the seed of liberation! With a mind that knows that all beings throughout space have been my mothers and fathers, With boundless love, great compassion, And the nectar of twofold bodhicitta sustaining me- Please grant your blessings that the lotus of omniscience may bloom! To ripen my being through empowerment, the three levels of vows being completely pure, To see the indivisibility of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the suchness of the natural state, With appearances and mind dawning as deities and great bliss- Please grant your blessings to accomplish the supreme fruition! Whatever the circumstances, when practicing in accord with the Dharma, May all obstructive conditions be pacified, and supportive circumstances be superb. Being inseparable from the lord of the family, the supreme lama, Please grant your blessings that the twofold benefit of self and others may flourish! Through the power of the lama embodying all objects of refuge, The Three Jewels, yidam deities, ḍākinīs, and Dharma protectors, Please grant your blessings that all these one-pointed aspirations Be swiftly accomplished without obstacle! This was composed for the sake of the bhikṣu and virtuous spiritual guide Jamyang Chogdrub. May it be virtuous!
